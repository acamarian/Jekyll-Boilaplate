### Browser Extension

And to get everything running in the browser install the [LiveReload Safari/Chrome/Firefox extension](http://livereload.com/extensions#installing-sections).

### Workflow

With `:serve => true` specified in the `jekyll-plus` guard options we can now start the Jekyll Web Server + LiveReload by using one simple command below:

```shel
guard
```

After the `guard` is executed some output will appear that looks something like this:

```shel

```

Now, switch to the browser, make sure the LiveReload extension is turned on at the righ top side of the browser window. 

If everything is configured correctly the line below will appear in the termina.

```shell
